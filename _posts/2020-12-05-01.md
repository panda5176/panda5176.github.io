<!--description-->

**Prevalence** rate is the total number of cases of a disease existing in a 
population divided by the total population. (genotype과 무관)


**Penetrance** measures the proportion of a population of individuals who carry 
a disease-causing allele and express the related disease phenotype. A disease 
shows *complete penetrance* if all of the individuals who carry the related 
gene are affected by the disease. (ON/OFF 비율)

**Expressivity** measures the extent to which a genotype shows its phenotypic 
expression. Just as individuals with a certain mutation can exhibit differences 
in disease severity, they can also show differences in many other aspects of 
their phenotypes, such as their age of onset of disease symptoms. (발현량)
